# Interview Notes
## AltaML 1: Initial Screening
**November 7th, 2024**
Questions were mainly concerned with learning about my knowledge and experience through stories of projects. I apparently answered the questions well.
I wish I had asked more questions during the interview. I only asked 2 questions, one during the middle of the interview and one after the interview.
I did not have this note-taking setup at the time, so I am writing these notes the day after. I can't remember the interview very well, partly because I didn't get much sleep last night.
